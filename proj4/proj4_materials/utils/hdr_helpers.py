    Given a set of pixel values observed for several pixels in several
    images with different exposure times, this function returns the
    imaging systemâ€™s response function g as well as the log film irradiance
    values for the observed pixels.

    Arguments:
        Z: N x P array for P pixels in N images
        B: is the log delta t, or log shutter speed, for image j
        l: lambda, the constant that determines smoothness
        w: is the weighting function value for pixel value
    Returns:
        g: solved g value per intensity, of shape 256 x 1
        le: log irradiance for sample pixels of shape P x 1
